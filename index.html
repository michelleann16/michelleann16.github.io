  <h2>PROFILE></h1>
  <p> I am 20 years old from Infanta, Quezon. Being a extrovert person, I can't live a day alone, I want my day to be exciting and fun. Whenever I am alone all I do is watch kdrama which helps my brain to relax and end release my emotions. Added to that, I chose this course because I want to have a thrilling journey to my future work and life. I love playing online games especially mobile legends which is my second hobby next to watching kdrama. Also I have a boyfriend although my father didn't know because he don't want me to have it yet. I have only one sibling, her name is Pauline. My favorite destination is beach which reminds helps me relax my mind and my mom gave birth to me in island so I always consider myself as an Island girl<3. My dream destinations are South Korea, Maldives, Netherlands, and Morocco.</p>
